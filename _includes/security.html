	<h3>Security & Reliability</h3>

		<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
			<h4 id="pcicompliant">PCI compliant</h4>
			<p>Geonomicsâ€™ processes and infrastructure comply with the highest Payment Card Industry and Gambling Commission security standards and we have had a full review of our systems and processes performed by a QSA to ensure we are in a position to self-certify and maintain that compliance.</p>
	
			<h4 id="safetyinbackups">Backup Safety</h4>
			<p>Backups will be regularly and frequently taken. All backups will be encrypted before transfer to a secure o-site location. (The o-site location will likely be either a geographically- constrained instance of Amazon S3 â€“ as is used by GeoLotto in the UK â€“ or to an alternate data centre.)</p>
	
			<h4 id="dataredundancynosinglepointsfailure">Data Redundancy</h4>
			<p>As in the UK implementation of GeoLotto and Treasure Hunt, the solution is architected with full redundancy to ensure that no individual server is a single point of failure. Thus loss of an entire server (be it physical or virtual), or switch will not halt the operation of the site. Additionally, all servers, firewalls and switches will have redundant disks, redundant power and redundant network connections.</p>

			<h4 id="independentsecurityaudits">Independent Security Audits</h4>
			<p>Geonomics has an annual independent security audit performed, the results of which are submitted to the UK Gambling Commission to meet their technical security standards. The security standards are based in part on ISO 27001.</p>

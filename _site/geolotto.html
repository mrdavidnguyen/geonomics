		<h2>Pick a place, any place</h2>
		<p>We use a map of your lottery region and divide it into squares which we call ‚ÄúGeos‚Äù. Each Geo acts as a lottery ticket. Players navigate the map to find places of significance to them ‚Äì their old school, their university or their holiday home.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
		<h2>Engage a new generation</h2>
		<p>Our fun and familiar Google Maps game-board is a smart reinvention of lottery gaming, allowing operators to reach out to new players.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>

<div class="row">
	<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-3">
		<h4>Multi-platform Gaming</h4>
		<p>GeoLotto is a browser-based game which runs on internet-standard infrastructure and is widely accessible on a variety of web browsers, including those supported by iPhone, iPad and Android.</p>		
	</div><!-- /col -->
	<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-3">
	<h4>Customised Geos</h4>
		<p>Players can make the game personal to them by customising their Geos. Geos can be given names and taglines, giving players the chance to tell everyone why they chose that location.</p>		
	</div><!-- /col -->
	<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-3">
	<h4>Social Media Integration</h4>
		<p>Not only can players use social media tools to invite their friends to play GeoLotto, they
can use it as a means of boasting about their wins! The in-built ‚ÄúShare My Win‚Äù option links GeoLotto to social networking sites, including Facebook and Twitter, allowing for a quick and easy announcement of their win.</p>		
	</div><!-- /col -->
	<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-3">
	<h4>GeoGroups</h4>
		<p>Players are able to form and to join GeoGroups, which act as syndicates. The groups allow players to pool their Geos and share wins, and offers a platform for group chat and communication.</p>		
	</div><!-- /col -->
</div><!-- /row -->

<div class="row">
	<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-3">
		<h4>Wish List</h4>
		<p>Because each Geo can be owned by only one player, certain Geos may be in high demand,
as many players wish to occupy that location. In this instance, players can add Geos to their ‚ÄúWish List‚Äù, and they will receive an alert when the Geo is next available, prompting them to log on to GeoLotto and purchase the Geo. Furthermore, the player who already occupies the popular Geo will receive an email alert telling them that the Geo has been added to another player‚Äôs Wish List.</p>		
	</div><!-- /col -->
	<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-3">
		<h4>Flexible Draw Structure</h4>
			<p>We endeavour to offer a game which offers maximum flexibility in allowing lotteries to create prize structures and odds which complement their requirements. A Hardware Random Number Generator is used to select Geos and allocate them to a prize tier.</p>	
	</div><!-- /.col -->
	<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-3">
		<h4>Game board configuration</h4>
			<p>The number of Geos placed over the map is completely configurable, and it‚Äôs up to you how many you‚Äôd like. We also vary the size of Geos ‚Äì larger Geos in rural areas, and smaller Geos in urban areas and on points of interest so that more people can be involved in the action! So don‚Äôt worry if you‚Äôve got areas of high population density ‚Äì we will adjust the size of each Geo so that everyone has a fair chance to play. This approach also keeps most of the prize winning Geos concentrated in relevant places!

<div class="row">
	<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">		
		<h4>Hosting options</h4>
		<p>We offer a variety of hosting options so that you may choose whichever works best for you. We are able to fully host or co-host GeoLotto, or can fully integrate the game with your own systems to allow you to independently host the game. The option you choose will have an impact on the cost and length of project and is something we can scope more fully once we understand your preferences.</p>
	</div><!-- /.col -->
	<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">		
		<h4>API (Application Programming Interface)</h4>
		<p>We have built our systems to be flexible and easy to integrate with lottery systems. For starters, this means we can offer Single Sign On, and are able to provide full reporting and auditing integration. We have further documentation which shows the flexibility of our APIs which we can share once we begin scoping how GeoLotto can work for you.</p>

<h3>Benefits for lottery operators</h3>
<p class="lead">How do our products help lotteries face the challenges of an industry in transition?</p>

<div class="row">
	<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-3">
		<h4>Attract new players</h4>
		<p>With an ageing player base and an increasing need to attract new, younger players, it is important for lotteries to ensure that their game portfolio appeals to a wider audience.</p>
	</div><!-- /col -->
	<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-3">
		<h4>Non-cannibalistic</h4>
		<p>Recent research conducted in the United States of America also shows that 75-80% of those interested in our games would play them in addition to the lottery games.</p>
	</div><!-- /col -->
	<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-3">
		<h4>Know your players</h4>
		<p>As players need to create an online account to play GeoLotto, you will very quickly build up a database with invaluable information on your players. </p>
	</div><!-- /col -->
	<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-3">
		<h4>Grow sales</h4>
		<p>By attracting new players to your online game portfolio, there is an immediate potential for growth across your entire game portfolio, encouraging increased player interaction with the lottery and, ultimately, higher spend rates.</p>

	<h3>Security & Reliability</h3>
	<p class="lead">Our products adhere to the highest standards for data security and operational reliability.</p>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
			<h4 id="pcicompliant">PCI compliant</h4>
			<p>Geonomics‚Äô processes and infrastructure comply with the highest Payment Card Industry and Gambling Commission security standards and we have had a full review of our systems and processes performed by a QSA to ensure we are in a position to self-certify and maintain that compliance.</p>
	
			<h4 id="safetyinbackups">Backup Safety</h4>
			<p>Backups will be regularly and frequently taken. All backups will be encrypted before transfer to a secure o-site location. (The o-site location will likely be either a geographically- constrained instance of Amazon S3 ‚Äì as is used by GeoLotto in the UK ‚Äì or to an alternate data centre.)</p>
	
			<h4 id="dataredundancynosinglepointsfailure">Data Redundancy</h4>
			<p>As in the UK implementation of GeoLotto and Treasure Hunt, the solution is architected with full redundancy to ensure that no individual server is a single point of failure. Thus loss of an entire server (be it physical or virtual), or switch will not halt the operation of the site. Additionally, all servers, firewalls and switches will have redundant disks, redundant power and redundant network connections.</p>
		</div><!-- /.col -->
		
	<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
			<h4 id="independentsecurityaudits">Independent Security Audits</h4>
			<p>Geonomics has an annual independent security audit performed, the results of which are submitted to the UK Gambling Commission to meet their technical security standards. The security standards are based in part on ISO 27001.</p>
	
			<h4 id="othersecuritymeasures:">Other Security Measures</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Segmented network architecture</li>
				<li>Tight access control</li>
				<li>Comprehensive logging and audit trails and daily log review</li>
				<li>Intrusion detection system</li>
				<li>Web application firewall</li>
				<li>File integrity monitoring</li>
				<li>Industry accepted best-practice build standards</li>
				<li>Regular patching cycles</li>
				<li>Secure coding standards</li>
				<li>Change management procedures</li>
				<li>Penetration testing and internal and external vulnerability scanning at regular intervals and upon significant changes</li>
				<li>Encryption of sensitive data</li>

		<h2>Pick a place, any place</h2>
		<p>We use a map of your lottery region and divide it into squares which we call ‚ÄúGeos‚Äù. Each Geo acts as a lottery ticket. Players navigate the map to find places of significance to them ‚Äì their old school, their university or their holiday home.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
		<h2>Engage a new generation</h2>
		<p>Locations are emotive and personal, and pose an attractive game proposition to Gen X and Gen Y who enjoy 'checking in' to places on Facebook and on Foursquare. Using Google Maps allows for an engaging game-board, encouraging players to interact with the lottery and experience the fun that is draw-based lottery gaming.</p>

		<h3>Services</h3>
		<p class="lead">Geonomics offers lottery operators a range of services to deliver the perfect gaming solution</p>
		<h4>Hosting options</h4>
		<p>We offer a variety of hosting options so that you may choose whichever works best for you. We are able to fully host or co-host GeoLotto, or can fully integrate the game with your own systems to allow you to independently host the game. The option you choose will have an impact on the cost and length of project and is something we can scope more fully once we understand your preferences.</p>
		<h4>Branding Integration</h4>
		<p>We will skin GeoLotto to your lottery‚Äôs branding so that it fits in seamlessly with any pre- existing online gaming portfolio you may already have in place.</p>
		<h4>Marketing Expertise</h4>
		<p class="fpo">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>
		<h4>API (Application Programming Interface)</h4>
		<p>We have built our systems to be flexible and easy to integrate with lottery systems. For starters, this means we can offer Single Sign On, and are able to provide full reporting and auditing integration. We have further documentation which shows the flexibility of our APIs which we can share once we begin scoping how GeoLotto can work for you.</p>

<h3>Benefits</h3>	
	<div class="row">
	<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-3">
		<h4>Attract new players</h4>
		<p>With an aging player base and an increasing need to attract new, younger players, it is important for lotteries to ensure that their game portfolio appeals to a wider audience.</p>
	</div><!-- /col -->
	<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-3">
		<h4>Non-cannibalistic</h4>
		<p>Recent research conducted in the United States of America also shows that 75-80% of those interested in our games would play them in addition to the lottery games.</p>
	</div><!-- /col -->
	<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-3">
		<h4>Know your players</h4>
		<p>As players need to create an online account to play GeoLotto, you will very quickly build up a database with invaluable information on your players. </p>
	</div><!-- /col -->
	<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-3">
		<h4>Grow sales</h4>
		<p>By attracting new players to your online game portfolio, there is an immediate potential for growth across your entire game portfolio, encouraging increased player interaction with the lottery and, ultimately, higher spend rates.</p>

	<h3>Security & Reliability</h3>
	<p class="lead">Our products adhere to the highest standards for data security and operational reliability.</p>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
			<h4 id="pcicompliant">PCI compliant</h4>
			<p>Geonomics‚Äô processes and infrastructure comply with the highest Payment Card Industry and Gambling Commission security standards and we have had a full review of our systems and processes performed by a QSA to ensure we are in a position to self-certify and maintain that compliance.</p>
	
			<h4 id="safetyinbackups">Backup Safety</h4>
			<p>Backups will be regularly and frequently taken. All backups will be encrypted before transfer to a secure o-site location. (The o-site location will likely be either a geographically- constrained instance of Amazon S3 ‚Äì as is used by GeoLotto in the UK ‚Äì or to an alternate data centre.)</p>
	
			<h4 id="dataredundancynosinglepointsfailure">Data Redundancy</h4>
			<p>As in the UK implementation of GeoLotto and Treasure Hunt, the solution is architected with full redundancy to ensure that no individual server is a single point of failure. Thus loss of an entire server (be it physical or virtual), or switch will not halt the operation of the site. Additionally, all servers, firewalls and switches will have redundant disks, redundant power and redundant network connections.</p>
		</div><!-- /.col -->
		
	<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
			<h4 id="independentsecurityaudits">Independent Security Audits</h4>
			<p>Geonomics has an annual independent security audit performed, the results of which are submitted to the UK Gambling Commission to meet their technical security standards. The security standards are based in part on ISO 27001.</p>
	
			<h4 id="othersecuritymeasures:">Other Security Measures</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Segmented network architecture</li>
				<li>Tight access control</li>
				<li>Comprehensive logging and audit trails and daily log review</li>
				<li>Intrusion detection system</li>
				<li>Web application firewall</li>
				<li>File integrity monitoring</li>
				<li>Industry accepted best-practice build standards</li>
				<li>Regular patching cycles</li>
				<li>Secure coding standards</li>
				<li>Change management procedures</li>
				<li>Penetration testing and internal and external vulnerability scanning at regular intervals and upon significant changes</li>
				<li>Encryption of sensitive data</li>

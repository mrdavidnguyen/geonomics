	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
	
	<p><small>Updated 27 April 2012</small></p>
	
	<p><strong>This Privacy Policy is issued by Geonomics Global Games Limited, a company incorporated in England and Wales (company number 06566718) with its registered office at 175 High Holborn, London, WC1V 7AA. In this Privacy Policy statement “Geonomics”, "we", "us" or "our" includes Geonomics Global Games Limited and/or any of its group companies. A full list of these companies is available from Geonomics.</strong></p>
	
	<h2>Use of your Personal Information</h2>
	
	<p>The purpose of this Privacy Policy statement is to set out how we use personal information that we may obtain about you. By using the Website you agree to this use.</p>
	
	<p>When you use certain features of this Website, for example when submitting a job application using the form on the Website, you will be asked to provide certain information such as your contact details. We will store this data and hold it on computers in order to be able to process the information. </p>
	
	<p>We will keep your information confidential except where disclosure is required or permitted by law (for example to government bodies and law enforcement agencies). </p>
	
	<p>We may use contact details that you submit to contact you about your submission, but will not use the information for other purposes.</p>
	
	<h2>Telephone Calls</h2>
	
	<p>Geonomics may record telephone calls made between Geonomics representatives and any person for training and quality purposes and for the protection of both parties.</p>
	
	<h2>Cookies</h2>
	
	<p>Cookies are small files of letters and numbers that we may put on your computer. Cookies allow us to distinguish you from other users of the Website which helps us to provide you with a good experience when you use our Website.</p>
	
	<p>Most web browsers allow some control of cookies through the browser settings. To find out more about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set and how to manage and delete them, visit www.allaboutcookies.org. Note that without cookies you may still be able to access some parts of the Website but certain functions may not be available to you.</p>
	
	<p>Please remember, cookies do not contain confidential information such as your home address, telephone number or payment card details. We do not exchange cookies with third parties.</p>
	
	<p>The only cookie we currently use on the Website is JSESSIONID. This cookie is used so that key pieces of our Website work properly. For example, so that you can navigate around the site. The cookie expires at the end of your session (i.e. when you close your browser).</p>
	
	<h2>Browser information</h2>
	
	<p>When you use our site, your browser sends us some information. For example, which language the site is displayed in, what operating system and browser you are using, and your IP address. An IP address is a set of numbers which is assigned to your computer during a browsing session whenever you log on to the Internet via your internet service provider or your network (if you access the Internet from, for example, a computer at work). Your IP address is automatically logged by our servers and may be used to collect traffic data about visitors to our websites. We do not use your IP address to identify you personally. We may also store what operating system and browser you used on the site and may use this information to generate anonymous traffic data.</p>
	
	<h2>Security</h2>
	
	<p>Security of your information is important to us and we have implemented measures to ensure that any information you submit (e.g. using the job application form) remain confidential and secure.</p>
	
	<h2>Internet-based transfers</h2>
	
	<p>Given that the Internet is a global environment, using the Internet to collect and process personal data necessarily involves the transmission of data on an international basis. Therefore, by browsing this Website and communicating electronically with us, you acknowledge and agree to our processing of personal data in this way.</p>
	
	<h2>General</h2>
	
	<p>You have the right to see personal data (as defined in the Data Protection Act) that we keep about you, upon receipt of a written request and payment of a £10 fee. If you are concerned that any of the information we hold on you is incorrect please contact us.</p>
	
	<p>Please be aware that our site may link to other websites which may be accessed through our site. We are not responsible for the data policies or procedures or the content of these linked websites.</p>
	
	<h2>Contact Us</h2>
	
	<p>If you have any comments or queries in connection with our privacy policy, please <a href="contact.html">contact</a> us.</p>

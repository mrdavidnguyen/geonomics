		<p><img src="images/2nd-chance-user-journey.png" class="img-responsive"></p>
		<h4>The User's Journey</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>A player buys a participating scratch ticket from a retail store. If he doesn't win, he can use the 2nd Chance access code on the ticket</li>
			<li>The players goes to the game website</li>
			<li>The player logs in or registers then enters their access code(s)</li>
			<li>The player's valid code assigns them a pre-determined outcome, win or lose</li>
			<li>If the player wants to dig again, he buys another ticket</li>

<h3>Features</h3>

<div class="row">
	<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-3">
		<h4>Multi-platform Gaming</h4>
		<p>GeoLotto is a browser-based game which runs on internet-standard infrastructure and is widely accessible on a variety of web browsers, including those supported by iPhone, iPad and Android.</p>		
	</div><!-- /col -->
	<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-3">
	<h4>Customised Geos</h4>
		<p>Players can make the game personal to them by customising their Geos. Geos can be given names and taglines, giving players the chance to tell everyone why they chose that location.</p>		
	</div><!-- /col -->
	<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-3">
	<h4>Social Media Integration</h4>
		<p>Not only can players use social media tools to invite their friends to play GeoLotto, they
can use it as a means of boasting about their wins! The in-built “Share My Win” option links GeoLotto to social networking sites, including Facebook and Twitter, allowing for a quick and easy announcement of their win.</p>		
	</div><!-- /col -->
	<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-3">
	<h4>Themed Games</h4>
		<p>Players can participate in exciting themed games, which the lottery can create for promotions. Game-boards can be set over Caribbean Islands, where players play for the chance to win a luxury Caribbean Holiday! Or sports venues can be the focus of a draw by celebrating the Olympics, the Football World Cup or local sporting events. This keeps the game fun and engaging, and gives players the innovation and change they’re looking for!</p>
	</div><!-- /col -->
	<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-3">
		<h4>Flexible Draw Structure</h4>
			<p>We endeavour to offer a game which offers maximum flexibility in allowing lotteries to create prize structures and odds which complement their requirements. A Hardware Random Number Generator is used to select Geos and allocate them to a prize tier.</p>	
	</div><!-- /.col -->
	<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-3">
		<h4>Game board configuration</h4>
			<p>The number of Geos placed over the map is completely configurable, and it’s up to you how many you’d like. We also vary the size of Geos – larger Geos in rural areas, and smaller Geos in urban areas and on points of interest so that more people can be involved in the action! So don’t worry if you’ve got areas of high population density – we will adjust the size of each Geo so that everyone has a fair chance to play. This approach also keeps most of the prize winning Geos concentrated in relevant places!

			<h4 id="pcicompliant">PCI compliant</h4>
			<p>Our processes and infrastructure comply with the highest Payment Card Industry and Gambling Commission security standards. We've also had a full review of our systems performed by a Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) to ensure our ability to self-certify and maintain future compliance.</p>
	
			<h4 id="safetyinbackups">Backup safety</h4>
			<p>We maintain regular and frequent backups of all system and game data. All backups are encrypted before transfer to a secure on-site location (either a geographically-constrained instance of Amazon S3, as used by GeoLotto in the UK, or to an alternate data centre).</p>
	
			<h4 id="dataredundancynosinglepointsfailure">Data redundancy</h4>
			<p>Our gaming solutions are architected with full redundancy to ensure that no individual server is a single point of failure.

Additionally, all servers, firewalls and switches have redundant disks, power and network connections for maximum failsafe protection.</p>

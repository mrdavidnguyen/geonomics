<p class="lead">Geonomics was founded in 2008 by brothers James and Henry Oakes with the aim of bringing a fresh approach to the lottery industry. From the outset the vision has been to create genuinely innovative products, built on rock-solid technology, delivered in a class-leading way.</p>

<p>Our flagship product, <a href="#">GeoLotto</a>, is an online lottery game that uses location technology to engage a new generation of lottery players.</p>

<p>Weâ€™re based in London, England and are privately owned.</p>

<p>In addition to its commitment to creating innovative games, Geonomics proudly supports Anthony Nolan, the UK blood cancer charity.</p>
<p>Anthony Nolan is a pioneering charity that saves the lives of people with blood cancer who need a blood stem cell, or bone marrow transplant. In 1974, Anthony Nolan's mother, Shirley, set up the world's first bone marrow register to match donors with people who desperately needed a transplant.</p>
<p>Geonomics runs regular fundraising events throughout the year and has raised thousands of pounds in support of Anthony Nolan's important work.</p>

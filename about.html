	<h3>Geonomics was founded in 2008 by brothers James and Henry Oakes with a vision of bringing new and innovative games to the lottery industry.</h3>
	</div>
	
	<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-8">
	
		<p>Our flagship products &mdash; <a href="geolotto.html">GeoLotto</a> (formerly GeoSweep) and <a href="treasure-hunt.html">Treasure Hunt</a> &mdash; are online lottery games that use location technology to engage a new generation of lottery players. We've been running both games in the UK since the end of 2010 under our own gambling license. We also sell and license our games to lottery operators around the world.</p>
		
		<p>Since our inception as Roboreus (we later rebranded to Geonomics in January 2013), we've grown to a team of over 40 world-class game designers, software  engineers, technologists and business experts, all led by an experienced and pragmatic management team.</p>
		
		<p>We're headquartered in London and privately owned.</p>

		<h3>Our Mission</h3>
	</div><!-- /.col -->
	<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-8">
		<h4>We're here to change the face of the global lottery industry.</h4>

		<p>As lottery players age, lottery operators are facing the enormous challenge of replacing their current customer base with the next generation of players. Typically younger and more engaged with technology, this new generation of players is a potential goldmine but their disconnection from traditional lottery gaming presents a hurdle for the growth of future revenue.</p>
		<p>We believe the lottery industry needs to create new games that appeal to new sensibilities. And we're here to make that happen.</p>

		<h3>Values</h3>

	<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-8">

		<h4>Change is an opportunity</h4>
		
		<p>We're not afraid of change, that's why we're here: innovating in the lottery industry takes courage, determination and intelligence. We've seen things that need to be transformed and we're ready to innovate.</p>
		
		<h4>There's always room for improvement</h4>
		
		<p>We make world-class products and deliver the highest calibre of services but that doesn't mean we're satisfied with our work so far. We're constantly striving to make our products better.</p>
		
		<h4>Our people can do great things</h4>
		
		<p>We believe our team of engineers, designers and business operatives are exceptionally gifted. We have a judicious hiring process, give our staff ownership of their work, and promote a relaxed but supremely professional work culture.</p>

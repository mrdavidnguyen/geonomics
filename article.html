	<h1>Shark Attack</h1>
	<p>On Friday 19th July, 4 brave members of the Geonomics team swallowed their fears (and a lot of salt water!!) and went swimming with sharks in aid of Anthony Nolan. There were over 15 massive sharks, including two 2.7m long Sand Tiger Sharks, 8 black tip reef sharks, and two 2.2m brown sharks, and several Bow Mouth and Nurse Sharks.</p>
	
	<p>The sharks came close enough to the fearless four that they could have reached out and touched them. Thankfully the guide assured them that they keep the sharks well fed so they shouldn’t have felt too hungry. In fact, sharks get a lot of bad press when actually; more people are killed by toilets than by the sharks!</p>

<p>The team managed to raise £1500, enough for 15 new sign ups to the bone marrow donor register. Good work guys!</p>

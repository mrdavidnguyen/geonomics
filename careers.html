			<h4>We're genuine pioneers in our field</h4>
			<p>While the U.S. has its high-flying tech startups, the regulatory constraints of the U.S. gambling industry discourages innovation. Here in London, free of those limitations, we're uniquely positioned as one of the world's leading lottery gaming startups. And we're investing all of our resources to take advantage.</p>
			<h4>We're young, smart and professional</h4>
			<p>We might be a young team but we're switched-on: we have extraordinarily high standards for our products and our professional conduct. We encourage collaboration, organisation and a firm adherence to the principles of Agile methodology.</p>
			<h4>We've created a great work culture</h4>
			<p>By assembling a team of bright, friendly and like-minded people, we've crafted an office culture that merges a great work ethic with a fun but relaxed social atmosphere. We believe in our team and empower them to perform.</p>

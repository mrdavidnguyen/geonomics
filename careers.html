			<h3>We're genuine pioneers in our field</h3>
			<p>While the U.S. has its high-flying tech startups, the regulatory constraints of the U.S. gambling industry discourages innovation. Here in London, free of those limitations, we're uniquely positioned as one of the world's leading lottery gaming startups. And we're investing all of our resources to take advantage.</p>
			<h3>We're smart, energetic and professional</h3>
			<p>Fusing the spirit of a young startup with the wisdom drawn from decades of senior management experience, we set the highest standards for our products and our conduct. We encourage creativity, collaboration, organisation and a firm adherence to the principles of Agile methodology.</p>
			<h3>We've created a great work culture</h3>
			<p>By assembling a team of bright, friendly and like-minded people, we've crafted an office culture that merges a great work ethic with a fun but relaxed social atmosphere. We believe in our team and empower them to perform.</p>

		<p>Our bright, modern office in central London is a genteel hub of thought and activity, decorated with a full gamut of novelty hats, and equipped with a pool table and fully-stocked bar. This fusion of the professional and the playful reflects one of our simplest desires: that we empower our staff to make meaningful contributions to the company's success while allowing them to enjoy their physical and social surrounds.</p>

		<h2>Pick a place, any place</h2>
		<p>We use a map of your lottery region and divide it into squares which we call 'Geos'. Each Geo acts as a lottery ticket. Players navigate the map to find places of significance to them – their old school, their university or their holiday home.</p>

		<h2>Engage a new generation</h2>
		<p>Our fun and familiar Google Maps game-board is a smart reinvention of lottery gaming, allowing operators to reach out to new players.</p>

		<h3>Pick a place, any place.</h3>
		<p>We use a map of your lottery region and divide it into squares which we call “Geos”. Each Geo acts as a lottery ticket. Players navigate the map to find places of significance to them – their old school, their university or their holiday home.</p>

		<h3>Engage a new generation.</h3>
		<p>Locations are emotive and personal, and pose an attractive game proposition to Gen X and Gen Y who enjoy 'checking in' to places on Facebook and on Foursquare. Using Google Maps allows for an engaging game-board, encouraging players to interact with the lottery and experience the fun that is draw-based lottery gaming.</p>

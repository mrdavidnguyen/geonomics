		<h2>Pick a place, any place</h2>
		<p>We use a map of your lottery region and divide it into squares which we call “Geos”. Each Geo acts as a lottery ticket. Players navigate the map to find places of significance to them – their old school, their university or their holiday home.</p>

		<h2>Engage a new generation</h2>
		<p>Our fun and familiar Google Maps game-board is a smart reinvention of lottery gaming, allowing operators to reach out to new players.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>

<div class="row">
	<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-3">
		<h4>Multi-platform Gaming</h4>
		<p>GeoLotto is a browser-based game which runs on internet-standard infrastructure and is widely accessible on a variety of web browsers, including those supported by iPhone, iPad and Android.</p>		
	</div><!-- /col -->
	<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-3">
	<h4>Customised Geos</h4>
		<p>Players can make the game personal to them by customising their Geos. Geos can be given names and taglines, giving players the chance to tell everyone why they chose that location.</p>		
	</div><!-- /col -->
	<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-3">
	<h4>Social Media Integration</h4>
		<p>Not only can players use social media tools to invite their friends to play GeoLotto, they
can use it as a means of boasting about their wins! The in-built “Share My Win” option links GeoLotto to social networking sites, including Facebook and Twitter, allowing for a quick and easy announcement of their win.</p>		
	</div><!-- /col -->
	<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-3">
	<h4>GeoGroups</h4>
		<p>Players are able to form and to join GeoGroups, which act as syndicates. The groups allow players to pool their Geos and share wins, and offers a platform for group chat and communication.</p>		
	</div><!-- /col -->

<div class="row">
	<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-3">
		<h4>Wish List</h4>
		<p>Because each Geo can be owned by only one player, certain Geos may be in high demand,
as many players wish to occupy that location. In this instance, players can add Geos to their “Wish List”, and they will receive an alert when the Geo is next available, prompting them to log on to GeoLotto and purchase the Geo. Furthermore, the player who already occupies the popular Geo will receive an email alert telling them that the Geo has been added to another player’s Wish List.</p>		
	</div><!-- /col -->
	<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-3">
		<h4>Flexible Draw Structure</h4>
			<p>We endeavour to offer a game which offers maximum flexibility in allowing lotteries to create prize structures and odds which complement their requirements. A Hardware Random Number Generator is used to select Geos and allocate them to a prize tier.</p>	
	</div><!-- /.col -->
	<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-3">
		<h4>Game board configuration</h4>
			<p>The number of Geos placed over the map is completely configurable, and it’s up to you how many you’d like. We also vary the size of Geos – larger Geos in rural areas, and smaller Geos in urban areas and on points of interest so that more people can be involved in the action! So don’t worry if you’ve got areas of high population density – we will adjust the size of each Geo so that everyone has a fair chance to play. This approach also keeps most of the prize winning Geos concentrated in relevant places!

		<h4>Hosting options</h4>
		<p>We offer a variety of hosting options so that you may choose whichever works best for you. We are able to fully host or co-host GeoLotto, or can fully integrate the game with your own systems to allow you to independently host the game. The option you choose will have an impact on the cost and length of project and is something we can scope more fully once we understand your preferences.</p>

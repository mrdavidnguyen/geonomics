		<h2>Pick a place, any place</h2>
		<p>We use a map of your lottery region and divide it into squares which we call “Geos”. Each Geo acts as a lottery ticket. Players navigate the map to find places of significance to them – their old school, their university or their holiday home.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
		<h2>Engage a new generation</h2>
		<p>Locations are emotive and personal, and pose an attractive game proposition to Gen X and Gen Y who enjoy 'checking in' to places on Facebook and on Foursquare. Using Google Maps allows for an engaging game-board, encouraging players to interact with the lottery and experience the fun that is draw-based lottery gaming.</p>

We have further documentation which shows the flexibility of our APIs which we can share once we begin scoping how GeoLotto can work for you.</p>

	<h2><a href="article.html">Shark Attack</a></h2>
	<p>On Friday 19th July, 4 brave members of the Geonomics team swallowed their fears (and a lot of salt water!!) and went swimming with sharks in aid of Anthony Nolan. There were over 15 massive sharks, including two 2.7m long Sand Tiger Sharks, 8 black tip reef sharks, and two 2.2m brown sharks, and several Bow Mouth and Nurse Sharks.</p>

	<h2>Geonomics BBQ</h2>
	<p>On Monday 8th July, the Geonomics team descended upon Highbury Fields for our first ever company BBQ! We were incredibly lucky with the weather and there were quite a few red shoulders and noses the next day. The BBQ was another one of our fundraising ideas for Anthony Nolan.</p>

		<h2>What makes location-based games so appealing?</h2>
		<p>With the market for traditional number-based lottery games starting to wane, our games are designed to tap into the behaviour of a new set of players: the tech-savvy generation.</p>
		<p>As the use of digital maps and "checking in" on platforms like Facebook and Foursquare has become commonplace, the concept of locations has become more personal and engaging than even before.</p>
		<p>By using the power of Google Maps as the basis for our innovative game-boards, our games offer players a fresh yet familiar way of experiencing the thrill of lottery gaming.</p>

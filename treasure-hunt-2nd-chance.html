		<h4>The User's Journey</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>A player buys a participating scratch ticket from a retail store. If he doesn't win, he can use the 2nd Chance access code on the ticket</li>
			<li>The players goes to the game website</li>
			<li>The player logs in or registers then enters their access code(s)</li>
			<li>The player's valid code assigns them a pre-determined outcome, win or lose</li>
			<li>If the player wants to dig again, he buys another ticket</li>
		</ol>
